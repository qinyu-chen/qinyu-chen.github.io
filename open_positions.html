        <h2>Open fully-funded PhD position on Efficient Brain-inspired LLM algorithm/hardware design</h2>
        
        <h3>Project description</h3>
        <p>We are looking for a PhD student to work on a brain-inspired large language model (LLM) system, including hardware and algorithm design on the edge with applications like speech assistance and rehabilitation for post-stroke patients. Brain-inspired computing (neuromorphic computing), inspired by the human brain's neural structure, offers a promising avenue for the real-time and low-power processing of complex signals. This approach is particularly advantageous in applications where rapid and efficient processing of signals is crucial for timely decisions. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have showcased their impressive capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as understanding and generating text that aligns with an individual style. Fine-tuning is a common method used to modify LLMs for particular downstream tasks. In this project, we aim to explore a compact, real-time, and ultra-low-power brain-inspired LLM system for applications like post-stroke speech assistance and rehabilitation.</p>
